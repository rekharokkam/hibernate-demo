Comparison of Data and Object Model
-----------------------------------

Identity
--------
Data Model - Primary Key
Object Model - equals()/Equal Operator to compare memory address

Associations
------------
Data Model - Foreign Keys
Object Model - Object References

Association Navigation
----------------------
Data Model - joins
Object Model - Accessors/References

Inheritance
-----------
Data Model - Not available
Object Model - Available

Challenges with JDBC
--------------------

1) Error Handling
2) Key Management
3) Implementation varies as database varies
4) Potential for errors - building the SQL queries
5) Verbose Code

There are 2 ways to annotate in JPA - Field and Property (getter method)
Field - annotated above the field
property - annotated above the getter method

When to use
-----------
Property - If the method has any business logic / validation then every time hibernate invokes the method the logic inside gets invoked.
Field - breaking encapsulation as Hibernate will access the fields that are marked as private.
